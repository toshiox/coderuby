# README

This application is made to provide functionalitys for my blog ToshioCode, the repo is here https://github.com/toshiox/React

The idea of ​​the application is just programming few API's in ruby ​​​​(I liked it more than I imagined :D)

If you want to run this project, just open the app directory at the prompt and run "ruby app.rb"
